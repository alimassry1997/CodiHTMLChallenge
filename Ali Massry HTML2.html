    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Animal rights is the philosophy according to which many or all sentient
      animals have moral worth that is independent of their utility for humans,
      and that their most basic interests—such as in avoiding suffering—should
      be afforded the same consideration as similar interests of human beings.
      Broadly speaking, and particularly in popular discourse, the term "animal
      rights" is often used synonymously with "animal protection" or "animal
      liberation". More narrowly, "animal rights" refers to the idea that many
      animals have fundamental rights to be treated with respect as
      individuals—rights to life, liberty, and freedom from torture that may not
      be overridden by considerations of aggregate welfare

        For some the basis of animal rights is in religion or animal worship (or
        in general nature worship), with some religions banning killing of any
        animal, and in other religions animals can be considered unclean.

            Hindu and Buddhist societies abandoned animal sacrifice and embraced
            vegetarianism from the 3rd century BCE. One of the most important
            sanctions of the Jain, Hindu and Buddhist faiths is the concept of
            ahimsa, or refraining from the destruction of life. According to
            Buddhist belief, humans do not deserve preferential treatment over
            other living beings. The Dharmic interpretation of this doctrine
            prohibits the killing of any living being.

            In Islam, animal rights were recognized early by the Sharia. This
            recognition is based on both the Qur'an and the Hadith. In the
            Qur'an, there are many references to animals, detailing that they
            have souls, form communities, communicate with God and worship Him
            in their own way. Muhammad forbade his followers to harm any animal
            and asked them to respect the rights of animals.
          </li>
          <li>
            to Christianity, all animals, from the smallest to the largest, are
            cared for and loved. According to the Bible, "All these animals
            waited for the Lord, that the Lord might give them food at the hour.
            The Lord gives them, they receive; The Lord opens his hand, and they
            are filled with good things". It further says God "gave food to the
            animals, and made the crows cry."

            Jainism is another ancient Indian religion. It is founded on the
            four main ideas of nonviolence, many-sidedness, nonattachment, and
            asceticism. Jain lifestyle is marked by vegetarianism and the
            avoidance of all harm to humans and animals. It is the strictest
            religion as regards avoiding harm to animals. All living things are
            meant to help one another. Killing is not allowed, even in
            self-defense. Going further than Hinduism and Buddhism
          </li>
          <li>
            Abrahamic religions, starting with Jewish traditions. In the Jewish
            Bible, one finds that God created all things and that all creatures
            are good in themselves. There are also some specific moral
            obligations toward animals, for instance the injunction not to
            muzzle an ox while it is working (Deuteronomy 25:4), and to help a
            fallen overloaded donkey, even if it belongs to your enemy
            (Deuteronomy 22:4). The prophet Qohelet, speaking about the
            prospects after death, holds that “man has no superiority over
            beast” (Ecclesiastes 3:19 NRSV). More noteworthy still, one finds
            passages where the author describes animals as part of the human
            community. God commissions Noah to save not only his family but all
            creatures in view of a new world order

    <h2>Philosophical and Legal Approaches</h2>
    <div class="Philosophy-text">

        <li>
          Utilitarianism: Nussbaum (2004) writes that utilitarianism, starting
          with Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, has contributed more to
          the<br />
          recognition of the moral status of animals than any other ethical
          theory. The utilitarian philosopher most associated with animal rights
          is<br />
          Peter Singer, professor of bioethics at Princeton University. Singer
          is not a rights theorist, but uses the language of rights to discuss
          how we<br />
          ought to treat individuals. He is a preference utilitarian, meaning
          that he judges the rightness of an act by the extent to which it
          satisfies the<br />
          preferences (interests) of those affected. His position is that there
          is no reason not to give equal consideration to the interests of
          human<br />
          and nonhumans, though his principle of equality does not require
          identical treatment. A mouse and a man both have an interest in not
          being<br />
          kicked, and there are no moral or logical grounds for failing to
          accord those interests equal weight. Interests are predicated on the
          ability to<br />
          suffer, nothing more, and once it is established that a being has
          interests, those interests must be given equal consideration. Singer
          quotes<br />
          the English philosopher Henry Sidgwick (1838–1900): "The good of any
          one individual is of no more importance, from the point of view ...<br />
          of the Universe, than the good of any other."

        <li>
          Abolitionism: Gary Francione, professor of law and philosophy at
          Rutgers Law School in Newark, is a leading abolitionist writer,
          arguing<br />
          that animals need only one right, the right not to be owned.
          Everything else would follow from that paradigm shift. He writes that,
          although<br />
          most people would condemn the mistreatment of animals, and in many
          countries there are laws that seem to reflect those concerns, "in
          practice<br />
          the legal system allows any use of animals, however abhorrent." The
          law only requires that any suffering not be "unnecessary". In deciding
          what<br />
          counts as "unnecessary", an animal's interests are weighed against the
          interests of human beings, and the latter almost always prevail.

          Contractarianism: Mark Rowlands, professor of philosophy at the
          University of Florida, has proposed a contractarian approach, based on
          the<br />
          original position and the veil of ignorance—a "state of nature"
          thought experiment that tests intuitions about justice and fairness—in
          John Rawls's<br />
          A Theory of Justice (1971). In the original position, individuals
          choose principles of justice (what kind of society to form, and how
          primary social<br />
          goods will be distributed), unaware of their individual
          characteristics—their race, sex, class, or intelligence, whether they
          are able-bodied<br />
          or disabled, rich or poor—and therefore unaware of which role they
          will assume in the society they are about to form.

          Feminism and animal rights: Women have played a central role in animal
          advocacy since the 19th century. The anti-vivisection movement in the
          19th and early 20th century in England and the United States was
          largely run by women, including Frances Power Cobbe, Anna Kingsford,
          Lizzy Lind af Hageby and Caroline Earle White (1833–1916). Garner
          writes that 70 per cent of the membership of the Victoria Street
          Society (one of the anti-vivisection groups founded by Cobbe) were
          women, as were 70 per cent of the membership of the British RSPCA in
          1900.
