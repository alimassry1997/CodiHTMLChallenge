      Naples-style pizza, is a style of pizza made with tomatoes and mozzarella
      cheese. The tomatoes<br />
      must be either San Marzano tomatoes or Pomodorino del Piennolo del
      Vesuvio, which grow on<br />
      the volcanic plains to the south of Mount Vesuvius. The cheese must be
      Mozzarella di Bufala<br />
      Campana, a protected designation of origin cheese made with the milk from
      water buffalo raised<br />
      in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio in a semi-wild state, or Fior di
      Latte, a cow's milk<br />
      mozzarella created according to the procedure for which it was registered
      as a<br />
      Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG)

    <h2 class="history-title">History</h2>
    <p class="history-content">
      A precursor of pizza was probably the focaccia, a flatbread<br />
      known to the Romans as panis focacius, to which toppings<br />
      were then added. Modern pizza evolved from similar<br />
      flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th<br />
      century. The word pizza was first documented in 997 AD<br />
      in Gaeta and successively in different parts of Central and<br />
      Southern Italy. Pizza was mainly eaten in Italy and by emigrants<br />
      from there. This changed after World War II when Allied troops<br />
      stationed in Italy came to enjoy pizza along with other Italian foods.

    <h2 class="Pizza-health-title">Pizza & Health</h2>
    <p class="Pizza-health-content">
      Frequent pizza eaters in Italy have been found to<br />
      have a relatively low incidence of cardiovascular<br />
      disease and digestive tract cancers<br />
      relative to infrequent pizza eaters, although<br />
      the nature of the association between pizza and<br />
      such perceived benefits is unclear. Pizza<br />
      consumption in Italy might only indicate<br />
      adherence to traditional Mediterranean<br />
      dietary patterns, which have been shown to<br />
      have various health benefits.

    <p class="Other-services-content">
      In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and<br />
      in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias.<br />
      Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged 2 years and over<br />
      consumed pizza on any given day. The Associazione Verace<br />
      Pizza Napoletana (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is<br />
      a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in<br />
      Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza. In<br />
      2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with<br />
      the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish,<br />
      and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list<br />
      of intangible cultural heritage. Raffaele Esposito is often<br />
      considered to be the father of modern pizza.
